operators, and constants that can be used in a formula or expression to
calculate and return one or more values. DAX helps you create new information
from data that is already in your model. Learning how to create effective DAX
formulas will help you get the most out of your data. Itâ€™s quite easy to create
a new Power BI Desktop file and import data into it. You can even create
reports that show valuable insights without using any DAX formulas at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>

ranges? Or, you need calculate year-over-year growth compared to market trends?

well. Learning how to create effective DAX formulas will help you get the most
out of your data. When you get the information you need, you can begin to solve
real business problems that affect your bottom line. This is the power in Power
BI, and DAX will help you get there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
